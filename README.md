# kvmPath

This is meant to be an easy shell script to run from an ubuntu or debian
box to successfully install kvm/libvirt and calculate conditions that will
contribute to it's installation success.

If it does not work for any reason, RTFM or consult libvirt directly

# Warning 

Please be sure that you are familiar with the current machine's repo's and packaging. I am not directly responsible for any mishaps that may compromise bootability.
